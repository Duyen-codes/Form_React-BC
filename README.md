### The project

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Fill in the form, submit
- Data from form inputs only get posted to JSON server once users confirm to post in the popup window

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React] (https://reactjs.org) - JS library

### What I learned

Recap over some of my major learnings while working through this project:

- Minimize using extra wrapping div whenever possible
- Created fake JSON endpoint for getting, posting, editting and deleting data from server

### Continued development

What I would like to continue focusing on in future projects:

- Responsive layout and design

Concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with or techniques I have found useful that I want to refine and perfect:
